## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To set the foundation right, start by cloning the project repository using Git LFS. Even if you plan to build all projects from the ground up, it's highly recommended to clone the entire repository. Cross-referencing your progress with the actual solution will prove beneficial.

**Attention:** Do not simply download the repository in a ZIP format. This will most likely result in errors upon opening. The correct approach is to clone it using Git LFS.

## ðŸ¤” Additional Information

When working on XR projects, it's common to handle large files such as 3D models, textures, and audio clips. This is why we use Git LFS, which stands for Git Large File Storage. Git LFS maintains a tiny reference or "pointer" instead of saving bulky files directly within the repository. This makes it efficient and avoids any potential issues with large files.
